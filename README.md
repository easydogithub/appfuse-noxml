# AppFuse on a low-XML Diet

This is a project I created for my SpringOne 2GX 2015 talk on #NoXML.

It includes the following:

* Spring XML to Java
* Spring Security Configuration to Java
* web.xml to WebApplicationInitializer
* Spring MVC to Java
* Migrated to Spring Boot
* Maven to Groovy

You can see these steps being executed in the [commit log](https://github.com/mraible/appfuse-noxml/commits/master).
